/**
 * Error text a person can act on: durations in seconds, not milliseconds.
 *
 * WHY THIS EXISTS
 * ---------------
 * Every timeout these plugins set is in SECONDS, `wp_remote_post( $url, array( 'timeout' => 20 ) )`,
 * and the error WordPress hands back when one fires is in milliseconds, because that is what
 * curl says:
 *
 *   cURL error 28: Operation timed out after 20000 milliseconds with 0 bytes received
 *
 * So the number in the message matches nothing in the code, and a site owner reading it cannot
 * tell a 20-second ceiling from a 20-minute one without doing arithmetic first. The managed
 * proxy had the same fault on its own alerts (its breaker reported "240000 milliseconds" for a
 * 240-second ceiling on 2026-08-17), which is what prompted fixing it on both sides.
 *
 * APPLIED TO EVERY WP_Error MESSAGE WE RENDER, not only the ones from HTTP calls. Deciding
 * per call site which WP_Error might carry a curl string is a judgement that has to be made
 * correctly 176 times and then re-made by whoever adds the 177th. The conversion is a no-op on
 * text with no millisecond duration in it, `wp_insert_post()` failures pass through
 * byte-identical, so the uniform rule costs nothing and cannot be applied wrongly.
 *
 * NOT SHARED WITH THE PROXY, deliberately. api.cloudscale.consulting runs without WordPress
 * loaded and its copy (cs_seconds_not_ms in text-lib.php) sits beside the failover
 * discriminator that reads the same curl strings to tell a slow provider from a dead one. The
 * two implementations agree and each is pinned by its own test; if you change the wording
 * here, change it there too.

/*
 * WRAPPED, not guarded by an early return.
 *
 * This file shipped in all five plugins with `if ( class_exists(...) ) { return; }`
 * above an unconditional `class ... {`, which reads as correct and is not. A
 * top-level class declaration with no parent is a candidate for OPcache's early
 * binding: the class is bound when the file is included, BEFORE the return
 * statement above it executes. So the second plugin to load fataled with "Cannot
 * declare class CloudScale_Error_Text, because the name is already in use" --
 * pointing at the very line the guard exists to protect.
 *
 * Measured on the local mirror, 2026-09-14, the moment a second CloudScale plugin
 * was activated alongside cyber-devtools: every admin page 500'd. It does not
 * reproduce under the CLI, which has no opcache, which is exactly why a guard that
 * looked right survived this long.
 *
 * A class declared INSIDE a conditional is never early-bound, so this is the form
 * that actually holds.
