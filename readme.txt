Database and media library cleanup with dry-run preview, chunked processing, image optimisation, and scheduled automation. Free, no subscriptions.

== Description ==

Most cleanup plugins delete things immediately with no preview and no control over what gets touched. **CloudScale Cleanup** shows you exactly what it found before anything is deleted, processes large datasets without timeouts, and gives you per-category toggle controls so you never accidentally clean something you need.

**Database Cleanup**

Choose any combination of:

* Post revisions older than a configurable threshold (default 30 days)
* Draft posts older than threshold (default 90 days)
* Trashed posts older than threshold (default 30 days)
* Auto drafts created when opening Add New Post and never saved (default 7 days)
* Expired transients that WordPress never cleaned up
* Orphaned post meta referencing post IDs that no longer exist
* Orphaned user meta left behind when users are deleted
* Spam comments older than threshold (default 30 days)
* Trashed comments older than threshold (default 30 days)

**Image Cleanup**

* Unused images in your media library not referenced in any post content, featured images, widget settings, theme mods, site logo, or site icon
* Orphaned filesystem files on disk in `wp-content/uploads` with no corresponding WordPress attachment record

**Image Optimisation**

* Resize and recompress JPEG and PNG images exceeding configurable maximum dimensions or quality thresholds
* Destructive operation — requires explicit confirmation before running
* Back up your uploads folder before using this feature

**Dry Run Preview**

Always run a dry run first. The plugin scans your database and reports exactly what it found — counts per category, individual post IDs, titles, and dates — without touching anything. Toggle states are respected so the dry run accurately reflects what the actual cleanup will do.

**Chunked Processing**

Cleanup operations use a three-phase chunked engine: a start action builds the queue and stores it in a transient, a chunk action processes one batch (default 50 items) and updates the transient, and a finish action reports the final summary. The browser never waits more than a few seconds per request. Handles arbitrarily large datasets without PHP timeout issues.

**Toggle Controls**

Each category has an independent toggle. Green means included, grey means skipped. Toggle states are saved and respected at scan time. Categories you never want touched can be permanently disabled.

**Configurable Thresholds**

Every time-based category has an age cutoff to prevent deleting recent items. Defaults are conservative — adjust to match your workflow.

**Scheduled Cleanup**

WordPress Cron-based scheduler runs database cleanup automatically on selected days at a configured hour. For precise scheduling on low-traffic sites, disable WP Cron and use a real system cron hitting `wp-cron.php`.

**Site Health Panel**

Live server metrics panel showing disk usage, storage runway estimate, and CPU/memory data via `sysstat` (`sar`) where available.

== Installation ==

3. Select the zip file and click **Install Now**
4. Click **Activate Plugin**
5. Go to **Tools > CloudScale Cleanup**

**Option 2 — Manual via FTP/SFTP**

1. Unzip `cloudscale-cleanup.zip`
2. Upload the `cloudscale-cleanup` folder to `/wp-content/plugins/`
3. Activate via **Plugins > Installed Plugins**
4. Go to **Tools > CloudScale Cleanup**

== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Will it delete things without asking? =

No. Every operation requires either a dry run confirmation or an explicit action click. The dry run shows you exactly what would be deleted before you commit to anything.

= Is it safe on large sites? =

Yes. All cleanup operations use chunked processing that queues items in a transient and processes them in small batches. There are no bulk DELETE queries that could time out or lock tables.

= What does "orphaned post meta" mean? =

When a post is deleted from WordPress, its associated meta rows in `wp_postmeta` are usually cleaned up too — but not always. Over time, rows can accumulate in `wp_postmeta` referencing post IDs that no longer exist. These rows are safe to delete and can add up to significant database bloat on active sites.

= What does "orphaned filesystem files" mean? =

Files that exist on disk inside `wp-content/uploads` but have no corresponding attachment record in the WordPress database. These are typically left behind when attachments are deleted through means other than the WordPress media library (direct FTP deletion, migration errors, plugin conflicts).

= Is ZipArchive required? =

Only if you use the image optimisation export feature. The cleanup and scanning features work without it.

= Can I undo a cleanup? =

No. Deleted database rows are gone. Take a database backup before running any cleanup, especially on a site you have not cleaned before.
